# StarBot Setup Instructions

## Environment Variables

To use StarBot, you must provide an OpenRouter API key. Create a file named `.env` in the project root with the following content:

```
REACT_APP_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_openrouter_api_key_here` with your actual OpenRouter API key, which you can obtain from https://openrouter.ai/.

After creating the `.env` file, restart your development server.
